# AnaSubjetsMC
Analysis tools of sub-jets in MC

# sim
- AliPYTHIA # macros and job submission scripts for PYTHIA 6 and Q-PYTHIA simulations with AliRoot framework
- AliPyPair # generate parton pairs with PYTHIA6 with AliRoot framework
- jewel # scripts used to generate JEWEL events
- py8 # macros and scripts used to generate PYTHIA 8 evenets
- Events generated by JEWEL and PYTHIA 8 are strore in HEPMC file and the ones generated with AliRoot framework are strore in ALICE std output format the "Kinematics.root" file and accessible by reading the "galice.root"

# rec
- src # use the generated MC evenets as the inputs and implement the jet, sub-jet finder, the outputs are ntuples
  - bak # some old macros which have the hitograms and THnSparse as the outputs
  - since the events format from different generators are not the same and the weighting method between PYTHIA and JEWEL is also different, several individual macros are used to perform the jet/sub-jet finding
    - to be optimazed, use one macros for all kinds of analyses
- scripts # scripts used to submit the jobs on PDSF
- merge # some macros and scripts used to merge the output objects (ntuples, histograms...)

# ana
- local analysis files
- master # ntuple based analysis
  - selectors # ntuple selectors
- pre # histogram based analysis
  - decode # macros used to calc the median, MAD... of a distribution
